# Auto Dice Roller

[My Notes](notes.md)

A small website where you can roll as many of the standard 7 Dungeons and Dragons dice as you want and your group can see the results.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable


For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Tired of dice rolling from your table onto the floor? Unsure if your players are fudging the dice they "rolled online"? Have trouble adding the 12 d6 of your rouge's sneak attack damage? Auto Dice Roller is here to solve all of these issues. Each user logs into a homeroom where they can roll as many dice as they need for their campaign. The website will automatically roll the specified number and type of dice and will share the results with the whole group, allowing the Dungeon Master to trust in the roll and preventing the slowdown that comes from players needing to count up each dice!

Here's a brief mockup of what the login screen of the site will look like

### Key features

- Secure login into group rooms
- Ability to choose one of the 7 standard D&D Dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100)
- Ability to roll any number of the chosen dice
- Roll totals pushed out to every active user in a group
- Ability for admin to create new groups and manage which users are allowed in each group

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Two HTML pages, one for login and personal rolls and one for group rolls.
- **CSS** - Adaptive screen resolution that works for mobile and pc displays. Clear and consistent styling throughout the site emphasizing the fantasy feel.
- **React** - Provides login and room selection. Receives input for dice rolls to send to the backend.
- **Service** - Endpoints for:
  -Login
  -Rolling dice
  -Retrieving roll results
  -Display random excuses to leave work and play D&D using the https://excuser-three.vercel.app/v1/excuse/office service.

- **DB/Login** - Stores users and created groups in a database. Credentials all stored in a database. Users can only join groups they've been authorized for.
- **WebSocket** - Whenever a user rolls, broadcast their results to the users in their group.
